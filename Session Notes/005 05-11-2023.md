## Session Notes
- After leaving the camp, we came to a wide river, and a bridge across it. But the bridge was 1000 feet up. Fortunately we had horses because we had to backtrack a bit to get onto the high road.
- After crossing the bridge, we came to another set of tall gates, like we passed to get into Barovia, with tall headless statues
- We came to another fork in the road, with one fork leading to the old Bone Grinder Mill, which allegedly grinds children to make Dream Pastries
- We looked into the Bone Grinder, but Steve sensed three fiends in there, so we thought perhaps not
- Arrived at the town, and met some guards at the gate.
	- They talked about "Festivals" that the Burgomaster is holding, and they seemed scared for people to find out that they don't like them, or him.
- We arrived at the inn
- Level 2!
