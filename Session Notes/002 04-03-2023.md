## Session Notes
- We arrive in town, the only sound is someone crying in the distance
- [[Ash Woodstock]] knocks on a door, and an old woman answers but isn't super helpful, apart from pointing us toward the inn
- Meet [[Ismark Kolyanavich]] in the inn, who says he'd like to meet us and treats us to food and wine
- He told us about his sister, [[Ireena Kolyana]] who has been suffering due to being the target of [[Count Strahd]]'s desire
- We agreed to help get her to another town, where she might be more hidden
- When we got to the house, she said she needed to bury her father first, who was the one who wrote the letter
- We headed out towards the church with [[Ismark Kolyanavich]] while [[Ireena Kolyana]] prepared to leave
