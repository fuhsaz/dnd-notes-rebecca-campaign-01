	- 2 nearly identical men at a closer table, seem pretty drunk, talking to each other
	- Barkeeper's name is Dannika
- Steve took the horses around back to the stable, and noticed some suspiciously intelligent ravens watching him
- Ordered dinner, and Dannika mentioned that they're used to receiving regular shipments from her husband's family (they make the wine), but have been seeing delays
	- Asked us to follow the Old Svalich Road towards the Wizard of Wines, essentially far to the west.
	- Offered free room/board if we do it
- Ash went over to talk to the two brothers
	- Nikolai and Karl, who are indeed twins
	- Asked them about the festivals
		- They also seem somewhat sketchy about them

	- They didn't want to talk though
- Ash will make some Goodberries before bed
