## How to view my notes and keep them up-to-date

I use a notes app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that lets me make nice links from note to note to hopefully organize them better. Because Obsidian would make me pay for cloud access to save my notes across several computers, and because then I couldn't share them with other people anyway, I use a version control system called [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to upload my notes and keep them up-to-date. 

### Setup
1. Install Git here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
2. Install GitHub Desktop here: https://desktop.github.com/
	1. This will allow you to use an application to keep notes updated and such, so that you don't have to deal with the command line
3. Install Obsidian here: https://obsidian.md/
	1. You don't _need_ this to view the notes, but it will take care of formatting and links for you.

### Pulling down a notes repository
1. Go to the URL for this particular repository: https://github.com/fuhsaz/dnd-notes-rebecca-campaign-01.git
2. Copy the URL provided to Clone it:
	1. Click the Green "<> Code" button
	2. Make sure HTTPS is selected under "Clone"
	3. Copy the URL, or click the button on the right side to copy it
3. Open GitHub Desktop and select "Clone Repository", then paste in the URL you copied

### Get the latest version of the notes
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click the "Fetch Origin" button, which will check if there have been any updates
3. If there are, it should prompt you to pull the latest changes
